There was a student that had to write a story for his class. He did not know
what to write but he had to write something as the assignment was due that day.
As the student rambled on into the text document about typing he tried to start
thinking about what he was writing about. He then thought to himself, "I can
write a story about not knowing what to write in this document." The student
thought that this was a great idea and sent it off to some other students to 
work on the idea.

However this idea was too vanilla. So the student, named student decided to
shake his story up. He then followed the crazy story dynamic that he had 
created in his dream the previous night. He had dreamt that he was in Madison
in the year 1000 BC. Now it wasn't Madison Wisconsin, obviously, but was just the 
same area. At this time, there were still the lakes but they were called lake U
and lake Rah. And in the lake he saw a badger sunbathing. 

The badger and Student looked at each other each comtemplating what the other
being was. Student in a daze, wondered if the badger was Bucky Badger. The
badger on the other hand, wondered if Student was going to attack and eat the
badger. Before each could make a move, a startling shout filled the sky. It was
the shout of wild, crazy viking with a giant horn.
