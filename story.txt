There was a student that had to write a story for his class. He did not know
what to write but he had to write something as the assignment was due that day.
As the student rambled on into the text document about typing he tried to start
thinking about what he was writing about. He then thought to himself, "I can
write a story about not knowing what to write in this document." The student
thought that this was a great idea and sent it off to some other students to 
work on the idea.
